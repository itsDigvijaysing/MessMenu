# MessMenu (Hybrid App)

<p>
Many people like me live away from home for studies, jobs, or business. We often eat at mess restaurants or order tiffin from freelancing housewives, as their food is budget-friendly (around 70rs per thali) & daily they update there menu. However, checking the menu at each restaurant manually by visiting it or by calling is inefficient. To solve this, I propose the Mess Menu app. This app, compatible with multiple platforms, allows users to view and order from all nearby mess restaurants and tiffin services.
